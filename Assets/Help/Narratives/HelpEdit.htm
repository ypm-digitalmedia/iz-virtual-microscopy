    Narratives</font></strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Welcome to Zoomify Narratives!
  &#160;&#160;Click the &quot;?&quot; button at the
    bottom of the Narrative Panel to view this Help anytime.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Introduction</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Zoomify Image Viewer
    enables <em>zoom-and-pan</em> viewing of high-quality images. Zoomify
    <em>Narratives</em> combine text, high-quality images, and intuitive navigation
    for better explanations and rewarding exploration.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Narrative Panel provides
    an intuitive text editor supporting standard formatting options.<font size="2">[1]</font>
    It also allows the narrative author to set which initial image and labels to
    show when a narrative is first opened. And the Panel provides three lists
    of items that may be linked to: <em>Zoomify Images</em>, <em>Media files</em>,
    and <em>Labels</em> within an image.<font size="2">[2]</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">When first opened, the
    Narrative Panel displays a new narrative with three example links. <em>Use
    the Preview button </em>at the bottom left of the Narratives Panel to make
    the links clickable. (You can also pass the cursor over the label link to
    see the Viewer highlight the related label in the image display.)</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">To create a link, select
    the text of a word or phrase in the narrative, then choose an item from one
    of the three choice lists at the bottom of the Narrative panel. To test the
    link, first use the <em>Preview button</em> to change to View mode to enable
    the links so they can be clicked.<font size="2">[3]</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Note: when in View mode
    the Preview button becomes an Edit button. Use it to to return to Edit mode.
    Also note: if preferred, text can be created in a word processor and pasted
    into the editor. If an HTML editor is used, the HTML characteristics will
    be preserved when pasted.</font></p>
  <p></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>File Management
    Features</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Use the button at the
    bottom left corner of the Narrative Panel to reveal file management options.
    Separate storage files are used for Narratives, Zoomable Images, Media files
    like graphics, video, and audio, and Label files (sets of labels). Simply
    select the file type to manage, and a list of current files will be displayed.
    Use the four included buttons to Upload or Download files or to create New
    files or Delete existing ones. (Note blank Narrative and Label files are automatically
    created if when starting, however, Zoomable Image files must be created using
    the separate Zoomify Converter. Create Media files in your tool of choice.)</font></p>
  <p></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Additional Features</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Narrative Panel is
    closely integrated with the Zoomify Viewer to empower intuitive exploration
    of the image details referred to in a narrative. Clicking a link immediately
    zooms and pans the view to the right location in the image - changing to the
    correct image first, if necessary. And simply placing the mouse over any link
    in the narrative highlights the relevant label in the image - an easy way
    to quickly preview the important points in an image - try it with the links
    in the example narrative! <font size="2">[4]</font>. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">For Narrative use, the
    Zoomify Viewer includes several optional features in the Viewport. These include
    the Navigator, Ruler, Image List, Toolbar, Annotation Panel, and Virtual Pointer.
    Each of these features is intended to be self explanatory, however, detailed
    information is included in the Zoomify User's Guide.<font size="2">[5]</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Zoomify Viewer and
    Narrative Panel provide a streamlined, integrated, authoring system. Efficient
    workflow may begin with initial creation of annotation labels within one or
    more Zoomify Images and proceed to authoring a narrative referring to the
    labels. Or, a narrative may be written, with annotation labels created, as
    needed, on-the-fly.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Zoomable image files (in
    ZIF format) are created using the Zoomify Converter - an intuitive drag-and-drop
    process that creates image files in a zoomable file format from source files
    in standard image formats (tif, png, jpg, or bmp).<font size="2">[6]</font></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">As always, features and
    functionality are intended to meet the needs of real-world uses. Customer
    feedback is welcomed!</font></p>
  <p></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Zoomify Mission</strong></font></p>
   <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ability to capture
     high-quality images of objects, places, and events is now commonplace - however
     - reducing the resolution of images prior to use is equally commonplace. Over
     one trillion images will be <em>down-res'd </em>this year - a waste
     of useful image data. Zoomify's <em>dynamic
     imaging</em> technology is a simple way to share and view images
     of <em>any</em> size. The Zoomify Narratives solution delivers efficient
     and standard authoring and publishing of text descriptions with links to details
     in high-quality images. Save the pixels!</font></p>
  <p></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Notes</strong></font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">1. Formatting
    options include Bold, Italic, Font Size, and alignment settings.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">2. The link list
    items are automatically discovered on the web server within folders specified
    by HTML parameters in the web page.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">3. Note: the
    initial mode of the Narrative pane and the Viewer is determined by HTML parameters
    in the web page. In typical use, two pages will be created, one for editing
    by authors, the other for viewing by web site visitors. The View/Edit mode
    button is not presented if the page begins in View mode.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">4. Two arrows labels
  are presented. The first is implemented as a <em>rollover</em> label - it is not
  displayed until the mouse moves over it (or at link to it in a narrative).</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">5. For descriptions
    of Zoomify Image Viewer optional features and instructions on their use, please
    see the Zoomify User's Guide as well as the many examples included in the
    Zoomify products and on the Zoomify website.</font></p>
  <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">6. Standard inputs
    formats for the Zoomify Converter include JPEG, PNG, TIF, and BMP. Standard
    output options include Zoomify Folders, Zoomify Image Format (ZIF), and Pyramidal
    File Format (PFF). Additional input and output formats are available in special
    editions of the Converter available on the converters page of the Zoomify
    website.</font></p>
