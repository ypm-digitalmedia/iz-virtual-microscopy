  Welcome to Zoomify Narratives!&#160;&#160;Click the &quot;?&quot; button at the bottom of the Narrative Panel to view this Help anytime.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Introduction</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Zoomify Image Viewer
    enables <em>zoom-and-pan</em> viewing of high-quality images. Zoomify
    <em>Narratives</em> combine text, high-quality images, and intuitive navigation
    for better explanations and rewarding exploration. The Narratives
    feature of the Viewer provides the ability to easily read commentaries with
    common formatting options as well as clickable links that can change the
    <em>Zoomable Image</em> that is displayed,
    links to <em>Media files</em> such as graphics or video files, and links to
    <em>Labels</em> within a zoomable image.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>Additional Features</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Narrative Panel is
    closely integrated with the Zoomify Viewer to empower intuitive exploration
    of the image details referred to in a narrative. Clicking a link automatically
    zooms and pans the view to the right location in the image - changing to the
    correct image first, if necessary. And simply placing the mouse over any link
    in the narrative highlights the relevant label in the image - an easy way
    to quickly preview the important points in an image. </font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Zoomify Viewer includes
    several optional features in the Viewport. These include the Navigator, Ruler,
    Image List, Toolbar, Annotation Panel, and the Virtual Pointer. Each of these
    features is intended to be self explanatory, however, helpful information
    is included in the Help displayed in from the &quot;?&quot; button on the
    Zoomify Toolbar.</font></p>
  <p></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>The Zoomify Mission</strong></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The ability to capture
    high-quality images of objects, places, and events is now commonplace - however
    - reducing the resolution of images prior to use is equally commonplace. Over
    one trillion images will be <em>down-res'd </em>this year - a colossal waste
    of useful image data aquired at extra cost and effort. Zoomify's <em>dynamic
    imaging</em> technology is a simple, standard way to share and view images
    of <em>any</em> size. The Zoomify Narratives solution delivers a efficient
    and standard way to author and publish text descriptions with links to details
    in high-quality images. </font></p>
