   <p>Zoomify <em>Narratives</em> combine text, high-quality images, and intuitive navigation for better explanations and rewarding exploration.</p>
   <p><strong>Quick Start</strong></p>
   <p>To begin now just delete this text and start typing â€” editing and Help
  buttons are below!</p>

   <p>Tip 1: mouse-over these links to highlight example labels in the image:
<a href="javascript:Z.Viewport.goToLabelByIDAndImage('Images/Narratives/ZoomifyImageExample1.zif', '0', null, false, true)" onmouseover="Z.Viewport.setLabelHighlightByDisplayID('0', false, true)" onmouseout="Z.Viewport.clearLabelHighlightsAll(true)"> 	Field of View</a>,
<a href="javascript:Z.Viewport.goToLabelByIDAndImage('Images/Narratives/ZoomifyImageExample1.zif', '1', null, false, true)" onmouseover="Z.Viewport.setLabelHighlightByDisplayID('1', false, true)" onmouseout="Z.Viewport.clearLabelHighlightsAll(true)"> 	Text</a>,
<a href="javascript:Z.Viewport.goToLabelByIDAndImage('Images/Narratives/ZoomifyImageExample1.zif', '2', null, false, true)" onmouseover="Z.Viewport.setLabelHighlightByDisplayID('2', false, true)" onmouseout="Z.Viewport.clearLabelHighlightsAll(true)"> 	Shape</a>,
 	<a href="javascript:Z.Viewport.goToLabelByIDAndImage('Images/Narratives/ZoomifyImageExample1.zif', '3', null, false, true)" onmouseover="Z.Viewport.setLabelHighlightByDisplayID('3', false, true)" onmouseout="Z.Viewport.clearLabelHighlightsAll(true)">Freehand Drawing</a>,
<a href="javascript:Z.Viewport.goToLabelByIDAndImage('Images/Narratives/ZoomifyImageExample1.zif', '4', null, false, true)" onmouseover="Z.Viewport.setLabelHighlightByDisplayID('4', false, true)" onmouseout="Z.Viewport.clearLabelHighlightsAll(true)"> 	Polygon</a>, and
 	<a href="javascript:Z.Viewport.goToLabelByIDAndImage('Images/Narratives/ZoomifyImageExample1.zif', '5', null, false, true)" onmouseover="Z.Viewport.setLabelHighlightByDisplayID('5', false, true)" onmouseout="Z.Viewport.clearLabelHighlightsAll(true)">Measurement</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    	Tip 2: click the Preview <em>Eye</em> button at the bottom left below to enable links. They can then be clicked to
    zoom in on a label, play video, or change images:
     <a href="javascript:Z.Viewport.goToLabelByIDAndImage('Images/Narratives/ZoomifyImageExample1.zif', '2', null, false, true)" onmouseover="Z.Viewport.setLabelHighlightByDisplayID('2', false, true)" onmouseout="Z.Viewport.clearLabelHighlightsAll(true)">Label</a>,
   <a href="http://www.zoomify.com/testing/narratives/Assets/Media/exampleVideoNASA.mp4" target="_blank">Media</a>,
    <a href="javascript:Z.Viewer.setImage('Images/Narratives/ZoomifyImageExample2.zif');">Image</a>.
    </p>

  <p>Tip 3: use the Save button often, and find file management features like New and Delete on the Files tab below!</p>

   <p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>
   <p>The Zoomify Image Viewer
     enables <em>zoom-and-pan</em> viewing of high-quality images. This Narratives
     feature adds intuitive authoring of commentaries with
     clickable links to details in the zoomable images.</p>
   <p>The Narrative Panel provides
     an intuitive text editor supporting standard formatting options.<font size="2">[1]</font>
     It also allows the narrative author to set the initial image and labels to
     show when a narrative is first opened. And the Panel provides three lists
     of items that may be linked to: <em>Labels</em> within an image, <em>Media files</em>,
     and <em>Zoomify Images</em>.<font size="2">[2]</font></p>
   <p>When first opened, the
     Narrative Panel displays a new narrative with three example links. <em>Use
     the Preview button </em>at the bottom left of the Narratives Panel to make
     the links clickable. (You can also pass the cursor over the label link to
     see the Viewer highlight the related label in the image display.)</p>
   <p>To create a link, select
     the text of a word or phrase in the narrative, then choose an item from one
     of the three choice lists at the bottom of the Narrative panel. To test the
     link, first use the <em>Preview button</em> to change to View mode to enable
     the links so they can be clicked.<font size="2">[3]</font></p>
   <p>Note: when in View mode
     the Preview button becomes an Edit button. Use it to to return to Edit mode.
     Also note: if preferred, text can be created in a word processor and pasted
     into the editor. If an HTML editor is used, the HTML characteristics will
     be preserved when pasted.</p>
   <p></p>
   <p><strong>File Management
     Features</strong></p>
   <p>Use the Files tab at the
     bottom Narrative Panel to reveal file management options.
     Separate storage files are used for Narratives, Zoomable Images, Media files
     like graphics, video, and audio, and Label Sets (files listing label types and positions).
     Simply select the file type to manage and a list of filenames will be displayed.
     Use the four included buttons to Upload or Download files or to create New
     files or Delete existing ones.
     <br><br>
     To rename any file, just select it in the filename
     list, click in the text of the name, and begin typing. Use the Tab or Enter key to submit the
     change. (Note blank Narrative and Label files are automatically
     created when starting, however, zoomable image files must be created using
     the separate Zoomify Converter. Create Media files in your tool of choice.)</p>
   <p></p>
   <p><strong>Additional Features</strong></p>
   <p>The Narrative Panel is
     closely integrated with the Zoomify Viewer to empower intuitive exploration
     of the image details referred to in a narrative. Clicking a link immediately
     zooms and pans the view to the right location in the image - changing to the
     correct image first, if necessary. And simply placing the mouse over any link
     in the narrative highlights the relevant label in the image - an easy way
     to quickly preview the important points in an image. Try it with the
     example links at the start of this help!<font size="2">[4]</font></p>
   <p>For Narrative use, the
     Zoomify Viewer includes several optional features in the Viewport. These include
     the Navigator, Ruler<font size="2">[5]</font>, Image List, Toolbar, Annotation Panel, and Virtual Pointer.
     Each of these features is intended to be self-explanatory. However, detailed
     information is included in the Zoomify User's Guide.<font size="2">[6]</font></p>
   <p>The Zoomify Viewer and
     Narrative Panel provide a streamlined, integrated, authoring system. An efficient
     workflow may begin with initial creation of annotation labels within one or
     more Zoomify Images and proceed to author a narrative referring to the
     labels. Or, a narrative may be written, with annotation labels created, as
     needed, on-the-fly.</p>
   <p>Zoomable image files (in
     ZIF format) are created using the Zoomify Converter - an intuitive drag-and-drop
     process that creates image files in a zoomable file format from source files
     in standard image formats (tif, png, jpg, or bmp).<font size="2">[7]</font></p>
   <p>As always, features and
     functionality are intended to meet the needs of real-world uses. Customer
     feedback is welcomed!</p>
   <p></p>
   <p><strong>The Zoomify Mission</strong></p>
   <p>The ability to capture
     high-quality images of objects, places, and events is now commonplace - however
     - reducing the resolution of images before use is equally commonplace. Over
     one trillion images will be <em>down-sampled</em> this year - a waste
     of useful image data. Zoomify's <em>dynamic
     imaging</em> technology is a simple way to share and view images
     of <em>any</em> size. The Zoomify Narratives solution delivers efficient
     and standard authoring and publishing of text descriptions with links to details
     in high-quality images. Save the pixels!</p>
   <p></p>
   <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
   <p><font size="2">1. Formatting
     options include Bold, Italic, Font Size, and alignment settings.</font></p><font size="2">
   <p>2. The link list
     items are automatically discovered on the web server within folders specified
     by HTML parameters in the web page.</p>
   <p>3. Note: the
     initial mode of the Narrative pane and the Viewer is determined by HTML parameters
     in the web page. In typical use, two pages will be created, one for editing
     by authors, the other for viewing by web site visitors. The View/Edit mode
     button is not presented if the page begins in View mode.</p>
   <p>4. Ruler values are set using the '...' button in the Ruler when in Narrative Editing
   mode. These values are stored in a 'sidecar' file along with each Zoomify Image. For additional details
    see the User's Guide.</p>
   <p>5. Two arrows labels are presented. The first is implemented as a <em>rollover</em> label - it is not displayed until
     the mouse moves over it (or at link to it in a narrative).</p>
   <p>6. For descriptions
     of Zoomify Image Viewer optional features and instructions on their use, please
     see the Zoomify User's Guide as well as the many examples included in the
     Zoomify products and on the Zoomify website.</p>
   </font><p><font size="2">7. Standard input
     formats for the Zoomify Converter include JPEG, PNG, TIF, and BMP. Standard
     output options include Zoomify Folders, Zoomify Image Format (ZIF), and Pyramidal
     File Format (PFF). Additional input and output formats are available in special
     editions of the Converter available on the converters page of the Zoomify
     website.</font></p>
